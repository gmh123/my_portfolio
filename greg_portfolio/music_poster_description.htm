     <h1><u>Objective:</u></h1>
     Based on Mos Def's song &quot;Love&quot;, I had to create a music poster that was well&ndash;representative of not only the song, but the meaning of the song as well.
     <h1><u>Method:</u></h1>
     Since Mos Def&#39;s song entitled, &quot;Love&quot;, talked more about community love rather than urban love, I decided to make more of a poster that represented a scene. I used a typographic brick wall that contained the lyrics of the song as well as graffiti like fonts to convey that urban/community atmosphere.
    <h1><u>Solution:</u></h1>
     I presented this poster to one of my professors and she felt that the song was very representative to Mos Def&#39;s style.
